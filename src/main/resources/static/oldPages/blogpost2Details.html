            <p>This is my second blogpost, and I have the pleasure to write this for you.</p>
            <p>Every morning in SUPSI, a student wakes up, it knows it must code fastest than professor or it will be
                expelled. Every morning in SUPSI, a professor wakes up. It knows it must code faster than the slowest
                student, or it will fired. It doesn't matter whether you're the professor or a student when the sun comes up,
                you'd better be coding.</p>
